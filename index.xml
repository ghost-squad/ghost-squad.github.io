A free-to-use app to render your images!
The challenge consists of a flask application. Three paths were defined:
Upload:
@app.route(&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;, methods=[&amp;#34;GET&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;POST&amp;#34;]) def upload(): if request.method == &amp;#34;POST&amp;#34;: if &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; not in request.files: return redirect(request.url) file = request.files[&amp;#34;file&amp;#34;] if file.filename == &amp;#34;&amp;#34;: return redirect(request.url) if file and allowed(file.filename): filename = file.filename hash = sha256(os.urandom(32)).hexdigest() filepath = f&amp;#39;./static/uploads/{hash}.{filename.split(&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;)[1]}&amp;#39; file.save(filepath) return redirect(f&amp;#39;/render/{hash}.{filename.split(&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;)[1]}&amp;#39;) return render_template(&amp;#34;upload.html&amp;#34;) Uploaded file extension is check using allowed.</description></item><item><title>CSAW CTF 2024 - Writeups</title><link>/posts/csaw-24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/csaw-24/</guid><description>Web/Log Me In I (definitely did not) have found this challenge in the OSIRIS recruit repository author: nikobelic29
The challenge have three routes:
/register -&amp;gt; create an account POST - username, password, displayname /login -&amp;gt; login to the account POST - username, password /user -&amp;gt; user panel that shows user information GET - Cookies[info] Our goal is to login as admin user, and for that we need to somehow set the uid value to 0 and visit /user to see the flag.</description></item><item><title>TFC CTF 2024 - Writeups</title><link>/posts/tfcctf-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tfcctf-24/</guid><description>TFC CTF was fun. Though we could only solve 2 of the challenges in the web category. Here are the writeups for the two of them:
Greetings This was a warmup challenge were we have to exploit an SSTI vulnerability to retrieve the flag.
In the homepage there&amp;rsquo;s an input and when we enter a value it is reflected in there. SSTI To know how the server is handling input we tried to inject %0a character into the username parameter which threw an error.</description></item><item><title>About Us</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>We are GhostSquad a small team of like minded and enthusiastic security researchers.
